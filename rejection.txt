🎅 Thank you for your submission!

To ensure this PR is nice and not naughty, this workflow works
only with pull requests that exclusively contain the `letter.gpg`
file. Since this PR contains other file modifications, it will not
be processed.

Feel free to update your PR accordingly, unless of course you
wanted to fix something in the repo.
